# Ninety-Degree Maze-Solving Robot

This repository holds the code for a 90° maze-solving robot car. Named after Wall•E because ultrasonic sensors look like the eyes of Wall•E!
This was a beginner's robotics project I did once. I reset the repository because of some insecurities, but I'm going to keep it up for posterity.

**Note:** The code was last touched on May 22, 2022. I'm not sure if it works anymore, but it should. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Purpose

The Robot Script is designed to have a constant flow of four-way proximity between the robot and walls surrounding it.
Using Ultrasonic sound transmitters, we can gather this information every (approx. :/) 2 seconds. Using the temperature sensor, we can calculate proximity using the Speed of Sound.

## Pseudo Logic

See the [‘flowchart‘](flowchart.md)

## Why?

For a [Destination Imagination Challenge](https://www.destinationimagination.org) :). It also incorporates sound science and mathematics for the execution of movement functions.
