# Ninety-Degree Maze-Solving Robot

This repository holds the code for a 90° maze-solving robot car. Named after Wall•E because ultrasonic sensors look like the eyes of Wall•E!

## Purpose

The Robot Script is designed to have a constant flow of four-way proximity between the robot and walls surrounding it.
Using Ultrasonic sound transmitters, we can gather this information every (approx. :/) 2 seconds. Using the temperature sensor, we can calculate proximity using the Speed of Sound.

## Pseudo Logic

See the [‘flowchart‘](flowchart.md)

## Why?

For a [Destination Imagination Challenge](https://www.destinationimagination.org) :). It also incorporates sound science and mathematics for the execution of movement functions.

### Faq

Are you aware your code is rudimentary?

> Yes, I barely have an idea of how to use a keyboard.
> Jokes aside, I am still a beginner in C++, and I am scared of classes.

What chip is the hardest to come by?

> I would watch out for Motor Drivers. They are sneaky fellows.

How do I wire the robot up?

> I forgot to post that. I will do that soon.
